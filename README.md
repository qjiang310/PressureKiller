## Inspiration
I always dream about using **AI** to help people make **art** piece. 
It's hard to let computer has its own idea about art, but we could make it an excellent tool for making art.

## What it does
One of our team mate is very **nervous** about school work and need something to do for **relaxing**, and our painting tool helps a lot.
## How I built it
Using processing, a software based on java.
## Challenges I ran into
Processing is totally new for us, and it takes sometimes to research on how does it work.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We made some Easter eggs!
## What I learned
A new language, a new team, and a new idea.
## What's next for PressureKiller
Make it an app for IOS.
